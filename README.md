> This is a maven-compatible fork of the ekit open source project
> made to be redistributable with Maven. It is based on the version
> 1.7b of the original project, currently at version 1.8
> 
> As the original license type changed, the package and project name changed, too.

> The code still is a fork of the 1.7b, so the version 1.8 is used. It is class compatible to the 1.7b.
